Objective:
The study focuses on using machine learning algorithms to recommend personalized diets based on health metrics like blood sugar, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and age. This diet aims to boost immunity and support COVID-19 recovery.
Methodology:
	1. Data Collection: Data from Kaggle was used, including information on diets, diabetes, and blood pressure.
	2. Algorithms Used:
		○ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
		○ Logistic Regression
		○ Support Vector Machines (SVM)
		○ Random Forest
		○ Naïve Bayes
		○ Decision Tree
	3. Data Processing: The dataset was preprocessed to focus on key features like glucose levels, BMI, and age.
	4. Model Evaluation: Decision Tree emerged as the most accurate algorithm (97.4% accuracy).
Findings:
	• Vegetal products (like cereals and vegetables) were more effective in boosting immunity compared to animal products.
	• Personalized diets were predicted based on user inputs like BMI, glucose level, and blood pressure.
Conclusion:
The study provides a framework for using machine learning to recommend diets that strengthen immunity. This approach can help individuals make informed dietary choices to recover from illnesses like COVID-19.
